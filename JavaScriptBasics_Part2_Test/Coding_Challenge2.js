//Test Case Result Counter
//After a test suite runs, you receive an array of test results (strings: "pass", "fail", "skip"). Write a JavaScript program using a for loop that counts how many tests passed, failed, and were skipped. Print a test report with total tests, counts, pass rate percentage, and a verdict (all passed → ready for release, ≤2 failures → review, >2 failures → block release).


let testResults = ["pass", "pass", "fail", "pass", "skip", "pass", "fail", "pass"]

let passCount = 0;
let failCount = 0;
let skipCount = 0;  

for (let i = 0; i < testResults.length; i++) {
    if (testResults[i] === "pass") {
        passCount++;
    } else if (testResults[i] === "fail") {
        failCount++;
    } else if (testResults[i] === "skip") {
        skipCount++;
    }
}

let totalTests = passCount + failCount + skipCount;
let passRate = (passCount / totalTests) * 100;

console.log("Test Report:");
console.log("Total Tests:", totalTests);
console.log("Passed:", passCount);
console.log("Failed:", failCount);
console.log("Skipped:", skipCount);
console.log("Pass Rate:", passRate.toFixed(2) + "%");

if (failCount === 0) {
    console.log("Verdict: Ready for release");
} else if (failCount <= 2) {
    console.log("Verdict: Review required");
} else {
    console.log("Verdict: Block release");
}
